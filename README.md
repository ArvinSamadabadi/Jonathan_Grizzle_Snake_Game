IS 3020 Snake Game Grizzle

This is a repository for a library of snake game code. I will post code of different snake games as well as several timer codes. 

Here is a general descrition of the game:

After doing research on what to create, I have decided to create a simple snake game program. While this may seem simple, it needs to have a built-in timer to see how long you have left to play the game. I chose this game because it is mind-numbing, and I need that after a hard day at school. The timer is so that a person can’t spend more than 5 or 10 minutes on the game. The snake game should close out after the timer ends or when you hit the block. When you lose the game, it should be able to come up with a graphic that has “Game Over” on it. I would like for it to have different colors and display a graphic that puts an X across the screen. I would like it to make a sound like if you get a question wrong on “Family Feud”. I would like for it have a simple background of black with blue tiles on the edges. The snake should be a light green color being about 10 blocks long. The obstacle should be a red circle instead of a red block. The timer should be located at the top center of the window. It can be a simple timer with the minute, second, and millisecond. The numbers should be green, and the numbers should blink when it gets down to 45 seconds.I am wanting a group of two to work on this. The graphics should not be too intense but have more pop to it than just a simple “Game Over” message that has no color to it. This game is intended to be mind-relaxing, so it needs to have a smooth feel to it. After the timer is up or game over message, a message needs to appear saying “Go back to work” or to some extent. I wanting to pull different snake games together to create a better one. This will require taking code from different websites and pulling what features I like to create a more advanced snake game. The goal is to make it look more modern than the snake game that was loaded into a 90’s Nokia Cell Phone.

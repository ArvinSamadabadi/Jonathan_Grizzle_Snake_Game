#Task List for Snake Game

1. Read through code to understand what the code is doing. I am needing to look for what each function does as well what can be change
   in the code.-DONE
2. Since the code is messy in it's current state, it needs to be cleaned up and lines need to seperated without ";".-DONE  
3. After looking through the code, I have decided that I would like to change the colors in the game. This includes the background, snake
   and the food blocks. The background should be black, the snake should be yellow, and the food blocks should be blue. To do this, I need to
   research on how to to change the colors.-DONE
4. After I have researched, the next step is to change to the colors. There is a website that has the RGB color codes. After I found this website,
   the next step is to change the colors. I need to find where the 3 number code is and change it.-DONE
5. The next step is change the message when the the sanke hits the edge. I want to change it to Your amazing score is "Score" + "!!!". To do this, I will need to change the code as well as add the excliamation points.- DONE
6. I want to add a timer to the beginner of the game. This will not allow the user to start the game until the timer is up. It should be
   ten seconds long.-DONE
7. I want to change the color of the score on the top left corner. I want to change it to be red, so it contrasts the snake color. To do this,
   I can change the RGB colors.-DONE
8. I want to add some instructions at the beginning of the game to make sure that users know how to use the game. This should not be too long,
   but it should be a short introduction.-DONE
9. I would like to change the size of the food. Instead of it being a small block, it needs to be bigger blocks. I will have to do research on how to change it. The snake should be changed also.- DONE
10. After the message pops up about the game being over, I would like for a sound to play indicatating that the game is over. I will have to do some research, but I should be pretty simple. It should the last thing that happens before the user exits the game.- DONE
11. I would like for the timer and directions to be in the pygame window and not in the terminal. I think this has to do with blit and render.- DONE
12. I would like to add "Your Score: " to the top of the window where the score count is kept!- DONE 
14. The name of the window needs to be changed to say "Snake Game". This has to do with the set caption line of code.-DONE 
15. Finally, the game needs to be tested to make sure everything works. In this stage, all of the bugs will be worked out to make the final product. -DONE
